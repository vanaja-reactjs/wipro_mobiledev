testing and reporting:
		testing and reporting are integral parts of the software development process. testing involves running various tasks-like unit tests to check small sections of code, integration tests ensure different parts work together, and acceptance tests to verify overall functionality.

		Reporting involves documenting test results and issues found during testing . this feedback loop helps developers identify and fix problems early, ensuring the software meets quality standards before release.
